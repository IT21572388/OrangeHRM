# Selenium Automation Practice Project

This project serves as a hands-on exercise to enhance my automation skills using Selenium and Python.
I used the demo website [OrangeHRM Live](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/) as the target platform for this practice.

## Test Scenarios Covered:

- Admin login into the system.
- Admin creating an employee.
- Searching and viewing fields.
- Editing and deleting an employee.

I've utilized the Page Object Model (POM) methodology to re-test some test cases in this project.
